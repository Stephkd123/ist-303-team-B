## Project Description

### The Olympic Transport Guide is a transport recommendation application designed to assist visitors and attendees of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games navigate the city efficiently. The app provides public transit schedules and transport options. The system personalizes recommendations based on user location, preferences, and time constraints to ensure an optimal travel experience during the event.

## User Stories

1. As a visitor, I want to see the estimated travel time for each transport option so that I can plan my trip effectively.
‚Ä¢	Estimated Time: 15 days
- Research and gather APIs to estimate travel time (e.g., Google Maps and public transit APIs).
- Design the UI layout to display travel time estimates for different transport options.
- Implement API integration to fetch travel time 
- Process and structure API data for seamless display in the app.
- Implement filtering/sorting functionality for different transport modes.
- Test API responses for accuracy and performance.
- Conduct user testing to ensure usability and effectiveness.
- Document implementation details and known issues.

2. As a visitor, I want to see the nearest public transport stations where I can easily access transport options.
‚Ä¢	Estimated Time: 15 days
- Use GPS to find the user‚Äôs location.
- Get data on public transport stations (bus, metro, train) APIs.
- Show nearest locations on an interactive map. 
- Display transportation options in a list for accessibility. 
- Build a filter for users to choose between public transport, ride-sharing, or both.  
- Have a search feature so users can manually enter a location and find its nearby public transport stations. 
- Test location/transport options and fix bugs/issues.

3.	As a visitor, I want to enter my location and destination to receive transport recommendations to choose the best option.
‚Ä¢	Estimated Time: 10 days
4.	As an event attendee, I want to filter transport options based on sustainability so that I can choose the best options.
‚Ä¢	Estimated Time: 6 days 
5.	As an admin, I want to manage transport service integrations to ensure accurate data updates.
‚Ä¢	Estimated Time: 10 days
6.	As a developer, I want to integrate an interactive map feature so that users can visualize transport routes.
‚Ä¢	Estimated Time: 14 days (21 days with updates)

### Task Breakdown & Timeline 

##### Day 1: Research & Data Gathering  
- Define what "sustainable transport" means (public transport). *(¬Ω day)*  
- Get data from APIs (Google Maps API, LA Metro API) to pull real-time sustainable transport options. *(¬Ω day)*  

##### Day 2: UI/UX Design  
- Build a user friendly UI to let users select sustainable transport options. *(1 day)*  

##### Day 3: Backend & Data Processing  

- Write backend logic to fetch and display the correct results. *(3 days)*  

##### Day 4: Testing & Validation  
- Test the filter functionality to ensure proper filtering. *(¬Ω day)*  
- Double-check the accuracy of displayed transport options. *(¬Ω day)*  

##### Day 5: Performance & Refinements  
- Optimize performance so filtering does not slow down recommendations. *(¬Ω day)*  
- Making refinements. *(¬Ω day)*  

##### Day 6: Final Review & Documentation  
- Document the work done *(1 day)*

## Task Planning & Burndown Integration:

The group discussed our sprint tracking method, which uses a burndown chart to monitor progress. The chart is structured over a 15-day sprint, with task estimates totaling 77 workdays. It tracks both ideal progress and actual task completion, visualizes sprint health, and adapts the workflow accordingly.
‚Ä¢	The final burndown chart is being maintained collaboratively and reflects updates from all team members.

## Team meeting notes

During meetings held twice a week on Wednesdays and Sundays over Microsoft Teams and daily communications via SMS group chat, the team focused on aligning agile planning efforts with the development of the Olympic Transport Guide project. Additional discussions were made on decomposing the key user stories into actionable tasks, and responsibilities were formally assigned to each team member based on their area of focus.

Assigned User Stories & Ownership:
-	**Rhett and Charlize** ‚Äì Enter location and destination for transport recommendations and identify nearest public transport stations
-	**Rohini and Tracy** ‚Äì User landing page, login, and signup
-	**Stephen** ‚Äì Database development and collaborating with both groups as a scrum master
Members committed to developing a breakdown of subtasks for their assigned work. These subtasks served as the foundation for the project timeline and were incorporated into the README.md and project planning documentation.
