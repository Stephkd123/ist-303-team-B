### Issues Identified

- **Issue 1-** The original code didnâ€™t allow the user to input their own topic, making it rigid and less interactive.
- **Issue 2-** There was no fallback in case of short or invalid input, which could break the program or lead to irrelevant results.
- **Issue 3-** Reference .txt files were saved in the root directory, causing clutter and making file management harder.
- **Issue 4-** Logic for all three execution methods (sequential, threads, processes) was repetitive instead of modular.
